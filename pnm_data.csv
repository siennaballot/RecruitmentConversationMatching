It focused on the service aspect by pushing students to volunteer more to better the community and raise awareness of issues by doing events in the quad. Such as Earth Day, an event that I lead to have students learn about healthy options for food and do activities to learn about issues and a way to help solve them. Also a big event that I led was the Outreach Fair where we contacted over a hundred agencies and over 50 of them came for students to be able to volunteer at these agencies and complete their service hours. As well as the co-president of the club the Thirst Project, which we worked with the non-profit Thirst Project by doing fundraisers in our community and at school all while spreading the awareness of this global issue thats isn't conversed much.

The very first organization I ever volunteered at was Sacred Heart, a non-profit that provides needs for the less fortunate. So I organized the clothes that people donated to make sure if they weren't soiled or holes. Or I sorted the food to put into bags to give or make bags for personal hygiene/baby necessities. Another place I volunteered at was American Cancer Society Discovery Shop, which is basically a thrift shop where all the money goes to the American Cancer Society. So I organized and priced the items, helped customers, and cleaned the store. Then my last two years in high school I volunteered at the Children Recovery Center for children with complex medical conditions, where most had to be fed through feeding tubes. I played with them and watched them for the nursed who were taking care of 5 kids at once by walking around the facility with them and playing with their toys to keep them entertained and give them attention.","Biological sciences ","San Jose, California ","Pioneer High School","San Jose","California","3.85","I played volleyball and softball all 4 years in high school while taking 6 to 7 classes.
